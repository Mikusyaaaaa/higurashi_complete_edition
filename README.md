# Interesting features

Higurashi When They Cry: Complete Edition — at default settings, it plays exactly as you remember it.

However, you have several new options at hand to customize your experience to your liking. 

For a visual effect, you can turn on "Parallax"
(the movement of the camera from the mouse cursor), breathing a little extra life into your favorite characters.

The "Blur" effect gives the game blurred backgrounds when your favorite characters appear.

Sharing your experiences has never been easier - Novella now seamlessly integrates with the Discord activity bar, allowing your friends to see your excellent taste in visual novels. 

Also, by default, the novel gives life to the characters! Now game characters can breathe, which is simply called the "Breathing Effect."

All these functions are fully optional (except for the "Breathing Effect") and they can switch with a single mouse click.

# Developing modifications

We've been working hard to develop a simple API for novel modding, allowing you to create custom modifications for the game.

You can also start developing modifications, even while developing the game itself, we can't wait to see what you come up with!
